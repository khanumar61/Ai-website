        <h2>The Beginnings of AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence began as a concept in ancient mythology, where intelligent beings or machines were created to assist humans. However, the formal study of AI started in the mid-20th century when Alan Turing introduced the concept of machines that could simulate human intelligence. Turing's famous question, "Can machines think?" became the foundation for the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the birth of AI as a field of study. The term 'Artificial Intelligence' was coined by John McCarthy, a leading figure in the AI community. Early AI researchers believed that within a generation, machines would be able to perform any task that a human could do.</p>
        <p>In the 1960s, AI researchers developed systems capable of solving problems in specific domains. The first AI programs were rule-based, requiring human programmers to define logical rules that the machine could follow. During this period, programs like the General Problem Solver (GPS) and ELIZA were created, which could interact with users in a rudimentary way.</p>
        <p>However, AI faced a series of challenges during the 1970s and 1980s, leading to what is known as the "AI Winter," a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research. Despite these setbacks, the field continued to evolve, with breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms and neural networks paving the way for modern AI systems.</p>
        <p>By the 1990s, AI had made a significant comeback, particularly with the advent of the internet and increased computing power. One of the most notable achievements was IBM's Deep Blue defeating the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. This event demonstrated the potential of AI systems to outperform humans in specific tasks.</p>
