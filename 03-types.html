        <h2>Narrow AI (Weak AI)</h2>
        <p>Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, refers to AI systems that are designed and trained to handle a specific task or a narrow range of tasks. These systems operate under predefined conditions and lack general cognitive abilities. Examples of Narrow AI include voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation algorithms on Netflix, and self-driving cars.</p>
        <h2>General AI (Strong AI)</h2>
        <p>General AI, or Strong AI, is a form of AI that is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. It has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that mirrors human cognition. General AI remains a theoretical concept, and no machine currently possesses the full capabilities of human intelligence.</p>
        <h2>Superintelligent AI</h2>
        <p>Superintelligent AI is an advanced form of AI that surpasses human intelligence in every possible way. It would be able to perform tasks more efficiently, solve complex problems, and make decisions far beyond human capabilities. Although superintelligent AI is still a concept, it raises significant ethical and safety concerns, as its development could lead to unforeseen consequences.</p>
